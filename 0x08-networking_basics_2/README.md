# Networking basics 2 #0

In this project I learned about **localhost/127.0.0.1** and **IPv4**.

* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* All files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/env bash```
* All your files must be executable

## Change your home IP

* Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements

Requirements:

* localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
* facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.
* The checker is running on Docker, so make sure to read this

## Show attached IPs

* Write a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine itâ€™s executed on

## Port listening on localhost

* Write a Bash script that listens on port 98 on localhost
